## DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

✅ Task 3: SEO Strategy

This task focuses on designing a comprehensive Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy for the Creamy Hub website. SEO is essential for increasing organic visibility in search engines, attracting qualified traffic, and improving the website's authority over time. A well-thought-out SEO plan ensures that Creamy Hub appears at the top of Google search results when customers look for cakes, delivery services, or dessert ideas.

The strategy document covers three critical pillars of SEO:

1.	Keyword Strategy: This section identifies high-intent, relevant keywords that Creamy Hub should target. These include both short-tail keywords like "cake delivery" and long-tail keywords like "best chocolate cake delivery in Marthandam." Keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ubersuggest, and SEMrush are referenced. The strategy also includes how to use keywords effectively in titles, meta descriptions, headings, and image alt text.
  
2.	Backlink Building: Backlinks are crucial for increasing domain authority. This plan includes tactics like:
   
o	Guest blogging on food-related websites.

o	Collaborations with local influencers and bloggers.

o	Listing the site on directories and food platforms.

o	Creating shareable content such as infographics or cake guides.

o	Asking satisfied customers or partners to link back to the website.

3.	Technical SEO: This section ensures the website is technically sound for both users and search engines. It includes:
   
o	Fast loading times (image compression, caching).

o	Mobile optimization.

o	Secure HTTPS protocol.

o	XML sitemap and robots.txt setup.

o	Clean and crawlable site architecture.

o	Fixing broken links and redirects.

The deliverables include:

•	A strategy document that explains the approach and implementation plan.

•	A SEO checklist covering all on-page, off-page, and technical SEO practices.

This task demonstrates a solid understanding of SEO fundamentals and provides a practical roadmap Creamy Hub can follow to climb up the search engine rankings and attract more customers organically.
